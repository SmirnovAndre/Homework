            <p>Jamaica is a Caribbean island nation covered in mountains, rainforests and reef-fringed beaches. Most of the country's all-inclusive resorts are located in the city of Montego Bay, famous for its British colonial architecture, and the settlement of Negril, which is considered the best place for diving and snorkeling. Jamaica is the birthplace of the reggae style, so in the capital of the country, Kingston, it is worth visiting the Bob Marley Museum dedicated to the famous performer.</p>
